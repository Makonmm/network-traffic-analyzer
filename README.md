# ðŸš€ Network Traffic Analyzer
A Deep Learning model built with PyTorch to classify network traffic as malicious or benign. The dataset is preprocessed using Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, ensuring high-quality feature engineering and data normalization.

## Performance:
- âœ… 97.08% accuracy on unseen data
- âœ… Only 2.9199% incorrect predictions, with:
Â Â Â Â ðŸ”¸ 0.2% false negatives
Â Â Â Â ðŸ”¸ 0.8% false positives

## Features
- Binary classification of network traffic (malicious vs. benign).
- Data preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy.
- Model evaluation with detailed metrics using Scikit-learn.
- Built with PyTorch
